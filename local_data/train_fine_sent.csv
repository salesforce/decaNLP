0,"For its 100 minutes running time, you'll wait in vain for a movie to happen."
3,"A chronicle not only of one man's quest to be president, but of how that man single-handedly turned a plane full of hard-bitten, cynical journalists into what was essentially, by campaign's end, an extended publicity department."

4,(Ferrera) has the charisma of a young woman who knows how to hold the screen.
4,A solid and refined piece of moviemaking imbued with passion and attitude.
4,"Flamboyant in some movies and artfully restrained in others, 65-year-old Jack Nicholson could be looking at his 12th Oscar nomination by proving that he's now, more than ever, choosing his roles with the precision of the insurance actuary."

3,What it lacks in substance it makes up for in heart.
3,"Carrying off a spot-on Scottish burr, Duvall (also a producer) peels layers from this character that may well not have existed on paper."

0,What's missing in Murder by Numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behaviour.
1,Any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director Jon Purdy's sledgehammer sap.
1,It's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay.

3,It made me want to get made-up and go see this movie with my sisters.

3,"Michael Moore has perfected the art of highly entertaining, self-aggrandizing, politically motivated documentary-making, and he's got as potent a topic as ever here."
3,"Frei assembles a fascinating profile of a deeply humanistic artist who, in spite of all that he's witnessed, remains surprisingly idealistic, and retains an extraordinary faith in the ability of images to communicate the truth of the world around him."
3,"Predictable and cloying, though Brown Sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle."
1,"Sadly, though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear, they can't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction."
